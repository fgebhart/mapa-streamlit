[![Python Tests](https://github.com/fgebhart/mapa-streamlit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fgebhart/mapa-streamlit/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A [streamlit web app](https://share.streamlit.io/fgebhart/mapa-streamlit/main/app.py) which let's you create 3D-printable
STL files using satellite elevation data ([ALOS DEM](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/alos-dem)) based on
[mapa](https://github.com/fgebhart/mapa).

This repo contains the source code of the streamlit web app, whereas the
[mapa repository](https://github.com/fgebhart/mapa) contains the source code of the algorithm which is responsible for
generating STL files.
