Hi my name is Fabian Gebhart :wave: and I am the author of mapa. mapa let's you create 3D-printable STL files
from every region around the globe. The elevation data is retrieved from
[ALOS DEM hosted by MS Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/alos-dem), which provides
satellite data with 30m resolution.
If you want to reach out, follow me or report a bug, you can do so via
[Github](https://github.com/fgebhart) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FabianGebhart).
For more details please refer to:
* the [mapa-streamlit repo](https://github.com/fgebhart/mapa-streamlit) which contains the source code of this streamlit app or
* the original [mapa repo](https://github.com/fgebhart/mapa) which contains the source code of the [mapa python package](https://pypi.org/project/mapa/)
Made with mapa-streamlit v{__version__}
